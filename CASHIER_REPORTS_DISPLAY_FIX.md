# Cashier Reports Display Fix

## Issue Description
When selecting a cashier in the reports screen, the cashier's reports were not being displayed. The screen was only showing basic metrics but missing the detailed sales data, charts, and period-by-period information.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Missing Frontend Data Display
The problem was **not** in the backend or API calls, but in the **frontend reports screen** which was missing the actual sales data visualization. The backend was correctly returning rich data including:

- `salesByPeriod` - Sales data grouped by time periods
- `productBreakdown` - Top products by revenue
- `customerInsights` - Customer analytics
- `creditSummary` - Credit sales information
- `paymentMethods` - Payment method breakdown

### What Was Happening
1. ✅ **Backend**: Correctly returning cashier-specific data when `user_id` parameter is sent
2. ✅ **API Service**: Properly sending the `userId` parameter to the backend
3. ✅ **Frontend Logic**: Correctly selecting cashier and calling API
4. ❌ **Frontend Display**: Missing the actual sales data visualization sections

### Data Flow Analysis
```
Frontend Cashier Selection → API Call with userId → Backend Returns Rich Data → Frontend Only Shows Basic Metrics
```
