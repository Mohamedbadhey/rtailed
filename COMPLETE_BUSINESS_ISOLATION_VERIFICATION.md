## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **If you see cross-business data:**

1. **Check Database Schema:**
   ```sql
   -- Verify all tables have business_id column
   DESCRIBE users;
   DESCRIBE products;
   DESCRIBE customers;
   DESCRIBE sales;
   DESCRIBE business_payments;
   DESCRIBE system_logs;
   ```

2. **Check Data Integrity:**
   ```sql
   -- Look for orphaned records
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE business_id IS NULL;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products WHERE business_id IS NULL;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers WHERE business_id IS NULL;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales WHERE business_id IS NULL;
   ```

3. **Update Orphaned Records:**
   ```sql
   -- Link orphaned records to default business (if needed)
   UPDATE users SET business_id = 1 WHERE business_id IS NULL;
   UPDATE products SET business_id = 1 WHERE business_id IS NULL;
   UPDATE customers SET business_id = 1 WHERE business_id IS NULL;
   UPDATE sales SET business_id = 1 WHERE business_id IS NULL;
   ```

### **If you see empty data:**

1. **Check Business IDs:**
   ```sql
   SELECT id, name FROM businesses;
   ```

2. **Verify Data Association:**
   ```sql
   SELECT b.name, 
          COUNT(u.id) as users,
          COUNT(p.id) as products,
          COUNT(c.id) as customers,
          COUNT(s.id) as sales
   FROM businesses b
   LEFT JOIN users u ON b.id = u.business_id
   LEFT JOIN products p ON b.id = p.business_id
   LEFT JOIN customers c ON b.id = c.business_id
   LEFT JOIN sales s ON b.id = s.business_id
   GROUP BY b.id, b.name;
   ```
