## ⚠️ ISSUES TO FIX (MINOR - Before Submission)

### 1. ⚠️ Test Code in Production Build
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Location:** `frontend/lib/screens/test/network_test_screen.dart`

**Issue:**
```dart
// Line 229
await _apiService.login('test@example.com', 'password', context: context);
```

**Risk:** Hardcoded test credentials in production code

**Solution:**
```dart
// Option 1: Remove the test screen from release builds
// Add to pubspec.yaml or build configuration to exclude test folder

// Option 2: Use proper test credentials (not production-like)
await _apiService.login('dummy@test.local', 'test123', context: context);
```

**Action Required:**
- Remove or exclude test screens from production build
- Ensure no test credentials exist in released code

### 2. ⚠️ Debug Print Statements
**Severity:** LOW  
**Impact:** Performance and security

**Issue:** Multiple debug print statements in production code:
```dart
print('🖼️ ===== getFullImageUrl START =====');
print('=== FRONTEND LOAD DATA DEBUG ===');
print('=== DEBUGGING STORE ASSIGNMENTS ===');
```

**Risk:** 
- Can leak sensitive information in logs
- Minor performance impact
- Unprofessional in production

**Solution:**
```dart
// Use conditional debug prints
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';

if (kDebugMode) {
  print('Debug message');
}

// Or use a proper logging library
```

**Action Required:**
- Remove or wrap all print statements with kDebugMode checks
- Consider using a proper logging solution

### 3. ⚠️ TODO Comments in Production Code
**Severity:** VERY LOW  
**Impact:** Code quality only

**Locations:**
- `frontend/lib/screens/home/store_management_screen.dart` (lines 252, 949)
- `frontend/lib/screens/home/superadmin_dashboard_mobile.dart` (multiple lines)

**Issue:** Multiple TODO comments indicating incomplete features

**Risk:** None for Google Play approval, but indicates incomplete functionality

**Recommendation:**
- Complete TODO items or remove comments
- Ensure all features work as described in store listing
