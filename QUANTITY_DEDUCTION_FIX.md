# POS Quantity Deduction Fix

## Issue Description
When selling a product with quantity 1 in the POS system, the total quantity was being deducted twice, resulting in a net reduction of 2 instead of 1.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Double Deduction Logic
The problem was caused by **duplicate quantity deduction** happening in two places:

1. **Backend Code** (`backend/src/routes/sales.js` line 123):
   ```javascript
   // Update product stock
   await connection.query(
     'UPDATE products SET stock_quantity = stock_quantity - ? WHERE id = ?',
     [item.quantity, item.product_id]
   );
   ```

2. **Database Trigger** (`retail_management.sql`):
   ```sql
   CREATE TRIGGER `after_sale_item_insert` AFTER INSERT ON `sale_items` FOR EACH ROW BEGIN
       UPDATE products 
       SET stock_quantity = stock_quantity - NEW.quantity
       WHERE id = NEW.product_id;
   END
   ```

### What Happened During Sale
1. Backend deducts quantity → Stock becomes (original - quantity)
2. Database trigger deducts quantity again → Stock becomes (original - quantity - quantity)
3. **Result: Double deduction causing incorrect stock levels**

## Solution Implemented

### Fix Applied
Removed the manual stock update from the backend code since the database trigger already handles it automatically.

**Before (Problematic Code):**
```javascript
// Update product stock
await connection.query(
  'UPDATE products SET stock_quantity = stock_quantity - ? WHERE id = ?',
  [item.quantity, item.product_id]
);
```

**After (Fixed Code):**
```javascript
// NOTE: Stock quantity is automatically updated by database trigger after_sale_item_insert
// No need for manual UPDATE here to avoid double deduction
```

## Files Modified
- `backend/src/routes/sales.js` - Removed duplicate stock update logic

## Database Triggers (Kept)
The following triggers remain active and handle stock management automatically:

- `after_sale_item_insert` - Deducts stock when sale items are created
- `after_sale_item_update` - Adjusts stock when sale items are modified  
- `after_sale_item_delete` - Restores stock when sale items are deleted

## Benefits of This Fix

1. **Eliminates Double Deduction** - Stock is now deducted exactly once per sale
2. **Maintains Data Integrity** - Database triggers ensure consistent stock updates
3. **Simplifies Code** - Removes redundant logic from backend
4. **Prevents Future Issues** - No risk of similar problems in other parts of the system

## Testing Recommendations

After implementing this fix, test the following scenarios:

1. **Single Item Sale** - Sell 1 quantity, verify stock reduces by exactly 1
2. **Multiple Item Sale** - Sell multiple quantities, verify correct deduction
3. **Sale Cancellation** - Cancel a sale, verify stock is restored correctly
4. **Sale Modification** - Modify sale quantities, verify stock adjusts properly

## Verification Steps

1. Check current stock of a product
2. Make a sale with quantity 1
3. Verify stock reduced by exactly 1 (not 2)
4. Check inventory transactions for correct recording

- **Frontend**: `frontend/lib/screens/home/pos_screen.dart` - POS interface
- **Cart Provider**: `frontend/lib/providers/cart_provider.dart` - Cart management
- **API Service**: `frontend/lib/services/api_service.dart` - Backend communication
- **Sales Route**: `backend/src/routes/sales.js` - Sales processing logic

## Notes

- The fix maintains all existing functionality while eliminating the bug
- Database triggers provide automatic stock management
- No changes needed in frontend code
- Inventory transactions are still properly recorded
- Customer loyalty points and other features remain unaffected
