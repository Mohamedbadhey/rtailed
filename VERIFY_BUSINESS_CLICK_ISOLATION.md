# Verify Business Click Isolation

## 🎯 **Goal**
When you click on any business in the superadmin dashboard, **ALL sections** should show only that business's own unique data.

## ✅ **What's Fixed**

### **Backend Issues Fixed:**
1. ✅ **Sales Query Fixed**: Changed from `customer_name` to proper JOIN with customers table
2. ✅ **Customers Added**: Added customers section to business details API
3. ✅ **All Queries Filtered**: Every query uses `WHERE business_id = ?`

### **Frontend Issues Fixed:**
1. ✅ **Customers Section Added**: Added customers management section to business details dialog
2. ✅ **All Sections Display**: All 7 sections now show in business details
